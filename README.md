# FederatedLearningTestbed

This repository implements basic steps in the model-centric federated learning (FL) model.

We implement both the FL server and FL client for Linux in the `Server` and `Client` folder respectively. We also implement a FL client for Android devices in the `AndroidClient` folder. The `CommonUtils` package is for shared resources between projects.
